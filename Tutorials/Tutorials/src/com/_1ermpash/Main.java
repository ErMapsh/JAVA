/*
    java is made up of class and functions,
    explanation:
    class is made up of functions. ie Home repair
    functions made up to perform specific task. ie plumber, painter, carpenter

    public static void main -->  return void, we can access main public function from anywhere

    Naming Convetions :
    1.For classes we use PascleConvention,
    2.For function we use camleCaseConvetion
