        /* OOPS---> object oriented Programming 
           normally we write a code that called procedure oriented programming(without using obect oriented programming)

            solving a problem by creating a object is one of the most popular best approches in programming, thats called oop
            
            what is object?
            object is instance of class(copy of class), we can use class methods, class attribute after allocating/creating a object.

         Terminologies 
         1.Astraction ---> hiding the internal detailes (use it , dont think about it how its work) ie. android development
         
         2.Encapsulation ---> the act of putting various components together (in capsual) like class ie. Laptop, car
         overall encapsulation means that the hiding a data can be hidden from the users

         3. Inheritance ----> The act of deriving new thing from existing thing.  ie.phone --> smarthphone      
         DRY ===> In inheritance we use dry thing
         
         4. Polymorphism ----> one thing many form
            ie. smartphone ----> phone
                smartphone ----> calculater
                smartphone -----> camera
                smartphone -----> diary
