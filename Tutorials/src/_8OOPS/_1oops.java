           normally we write a code that called procedure oriented programming(without using obect oriented programming)

            solving a problem by creating a object is one of the most popular best approches in programming, thats called oop
            
            what is object?
            object is instance of class(copy of class), we can use class methods, class attribute after allocating/creating a object.
